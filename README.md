## Tools üîß

This sections lists end-user tools.

### AASPortal

AASPortal is a Node.js based web portal for the visualization and management of Asset Administration Shells (AAS).

Images available at Dockerhub.

https://github.com/FraunhoferIOSB/AASPortal

### AAS Core CLI Swiss Knife

Provide a set of command-line tools to:
* Convert CSV tables to AAS,
* Validate instances of AAS,
* Tree-shake concept descriptions,
* Check for dangling references, and
* Convert AAS to static file structures (in form of directories and JSON files) such that they can be statically served by a HTTP server (*e.g.* nginx) as a read-only AAS server.

Supports v3.0 of the AAS meta-model.

https://github.com/aas-core-works/aas-core3.0-cli-swiss-knife

### AAS Core React Editor
An editor of an AAS, implemented in React and TypeScript, which runs directly in the browser.

Contained as a single HTML file and needs no server or backend.

Supports v3.0RC02 of the meta-model.

https://github.com/aas-core-works/aas-core3.0rc02-react-editor

### AAS Manager
Cross-platform visual viewer/editor implemented in Python and based on PyQt Framework and BaSyx-Python-SDK.

Pre-build binaries available for Windows 10, Linux and MacOS.

https://github.com/rwth-iat/aas_manager

### AAS Submodel Python Code Generator
Code generator tool built on top of the BaSyx-Python-SDK. 

It generates Submodel-specific classes and classes for its submodel elements with filled meta-information derived from AASX submodel templates. The generated classes can then be used for submodel instantiation. 

Also contains generated classes for some of IDTA Submodels.
